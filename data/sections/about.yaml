# a summary about you
summary: 'With an increasing passion for Computer Science during my high school, I pursued my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Engineering from KJSCE, Mumbai, India. My research interests include Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Data Science. I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy developing solutions that solve real-life problems. When I am not engrossed in research or coding, I enjoy Photography, Cricket, and watching Formula 1.'

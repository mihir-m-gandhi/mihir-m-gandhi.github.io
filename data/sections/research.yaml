  name: Adaptive Traffic Signal Timer
  icon: fa-car
  timeframe: Apr 2019 - Sep 2020
  description: Worked on a research project to develop a Computer Vision-based Adaptive Traffic Signal Timer under the guidance of Prof. Nirmala Shinde Baloorkar. Developed a system that utilizes live images from the cameras at traffic junctions for real-time traffic density calculation using YOLO object detection and sets the signal timers accordingly, thus reducing the traffic congestion on roads, providing faster transit to people, and reducing fuel consumption.
  details: 
  - Trained a custom YOLO object detection model for vehicle detection to count vehicles by class such as car, bus, truck, bike, and rickshaw.
  - Devised a signal-switching algorithm that sets signal timers according to the number of vehicles of each class
  - Built a simulation using Pygames to measure its effectiveness over the fixed timer system
  - The system reduced the waiting time of vehicles at traffic signals by 23%

  name: Decentralized Freelancing System
  icon: fa-link
  timeframe: Sep 2018 - Sep 2019
  description:   Proposed a blockchain-based decentralized freelancing platform to ensure trust between employer and employee, and prevent issues such as late payment, delayed work, and unfair evaluation of work.
  details: 
  - A research project to create a decentralized platform for posting and accepting freelance jobs using Blockchain technology
  - Used Solidity to implement the smart contracts and deployed them on Ropsten Testnet
  - Developed a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed it on the Ethereum Blockchain
  - Employed IPFS for distributed storage of user files such as resumes and consignment details

  name: Sign Language Recognition using CNN
  icon: fa-american-sign-language-interpreting
  timeframe: Jan 2019 - May 2020
  description: Developed a Convolutional Neural Network for Sign Language Recognition under the guidance of Dr. Prasanna Shette.
  details: 
  - Developed an application to identify hand gestures to assist people in communicating with the speech and hearing impaired using Deep Learning and Computer Vision
  - Trained a Convoluted Neural Network on the American Sign Language dataset, which consists of 31,000 images of hand gestures for alphabets(A-Z) and numbers(1-9) using Keras
  - Deployed the CNN in an Android app using TensorFlow Lite to enable offline and mobile use
  - The CNN achieved an accuracy of 89% with an average detection time of 1.2 seconds

- title: Adaptive Traffic Signal Timer
  projectImage: images/sections/projects/adaptive-traffic-signal-timer.jpg
  description: This Adaptive Traffic Signal Timer uses live images from the cameras at traffic junctions for traffic density calculation using YOLO object detection and sets the signal timers accordingly, thus reducing the traffic congestion on roads, providing faster transit to people, and reducing fuel consumption.

- title: Tree Disease Spread Cellular Automata
  projectImage: images/sections/projects/tree-disease-spread-cellular-automata.png
  description: In this project, we propose a system that models the spread of disease throughout the branches of individual fruit trees, in which we will compute the “optimal” shape that a tree should be pruned to prior to the onset of the disease.
